# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-11

## Overview

The EchoKey text expander is designed with privacy as a core tenet. It operates entirely locally on your machine.

## Data Collection

- **We do not collect any personal data.**
- **We do not transmit any data to external servers.**
- The extension does not include analytics or telemetry trackers.

## Data Storage

- All data (custom snippets, usage statistics, settings) is stored locally in your browser using the `chrome.storage.local` API.
- This data never leaves your device unless you manually export it via the "Export" feature.

## Permissions

The extension requires minimal permissions to function:
- `storage`: To save your snippets and preferences.
- `clipboardWrite`: To allow copying snippet data to the clipboard during export.
- `activeTab` / `scripting`: To insert text into the active field when you trigger an expansion.
